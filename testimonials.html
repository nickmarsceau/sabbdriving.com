            I was a nervous 15-year-old who was not excited about driving, but Mr. Sabb
            patiently put me through my paces. He always seemed relaxed when giving
            instruction even though I am sure my driving left much to be desired. I can
            still remember the helpful videos we watched and hear him telling me to look
            as far down the road as I could instead of getting caught up in what was directly
            ahead of me. I also remember well his saying &lsquo;a quick look is a good look&rsquo;
            when needing to look somewhere other than directly ahead of me. I am thankful for
            his help in getting me started down the path of good driving.&rdquo;

            really helped me to feel calm and confident about my driving ability, partly due to the fact
            that you give practical, clear instructions, and also because you yourself have an uncanny
            ability to be calm with new drivers! (I still don't know how that is possible.) : ) The
